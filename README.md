Project Overview: 
Scraping customer product reviews, prices, and brands for any product on any e-commerce website and comparing prices, quality, and comments.
This scraped data will be used for further dashboarding and analysis where the customer can set their preferences concerning a certain range of products and receive an email containing the list of the suited products for them.
Web scraping is a technique used to extract large volumes of data from websites where data is publicly available programmatically. 
Our project will focus on product and customer data  in e-commerce web pages such as star ratings, prices, and quality reviews ..to compare them and analyze customer inferences.

This project will help as a tool for businesses to better understand the reach of their products through the analysis of customer reviews.
It will also allow the customers to shop more comfortably. This way they can know about insightful trends of customers and fine-tune their products and services accordingly.
